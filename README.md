# Social Network with Facial Authentication

## Project Description 

This project focuses mainly facial recognition using Deep learning

Django framework is used for backend and Bootstrap4 is used for frontend.

Redis server is used for chat.

The face_recognition by [Adam](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) is used for recognize users and identify them. 

Thanks to Corey Schafer for helping me learn Django

It's better if you have a CUDA compatible GPU so identifying users will be faster.
